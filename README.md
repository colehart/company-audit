# Module 1 Assessment Starter Kit

Read the Evaluation Rubric at the end of this README to familiarize yourself with the grading.

This project will serve as the jumping-off point for several module one assessment challenges. Before your assessment, you should clone this repository, run `bundle`, and make sure all the tests pass by running `rake`.

Then, spend a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the structure and contents of the project. So far it contains a single Ruby module, an empty class, and some accompanying tests.

## Running Tests

From the project's root, `rake` like a boss.

## Installing Dependencies

You will probably already have the gems needed for this project already on your machine, but if not, `bundle`.

## Where do you go from here?

Your instructors will provide notes to accompany this repo.
